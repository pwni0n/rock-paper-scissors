# rock-paper-scissors
For this project, I'll be creating a simple implementation of rock paper scissors using JavaScript. The first iteration of this project will be done solely in the console, but I will revisit this project to add a user interface later on.

With this project, I am demonstrating these skills:
- Setting up JavaScript to work on the web page
- Coding in the JavaScript language
- Applying problem-solving skills to create the game
